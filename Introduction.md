## Introduction 
### What is TypeScript?
- TypeScript is an open source, typed syntactic superset of JavaScript.
### Why developers want types
- It allows you, as a code author, to leave more of your intent “on the page” => Types make the author’s intent more clear
```js
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b
}
add(3, 4);
```
